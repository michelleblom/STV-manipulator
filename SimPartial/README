SimPartial is designed to simulate an STV election until a given number K
of candidate remain standing. To run the simulator, compile with the
given Makefile and run with the command:

(For example)

./stv -ballots "../2019/federal_2019_ACT.txt" -simuntil 10 federal_2019_ACT_simUntil10.txt 

The above command simulates for 10 rounds and then stops, recording a |C|-10 candidate election in federal_2019_ACT_simUntil10.txt.

Note that the -quota_override flag (not used above) is only used when simulating a partial election. If we don't use the flag, a quota based on the election tail will be computed.
